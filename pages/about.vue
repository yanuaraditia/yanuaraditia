            <p>My name is Yanuar Aditia. Born and raised in Kebumen, Central Java, and currently reside in Yogyakarta. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in informatics engineering from the University of Amikom Yogyakarta, with a focus on database and web development.</p>
            <p>During my academic years, I participated in various activities to increase my skills in full-stack web development, including winning the AMICTA competition. My project focuses on how to integrate apps into the "internet of things" to handle a parking lot availability issue. Since February 2020, I've been working as a full-stack web developer for TRIES DIGITAL. I was in charge of creating back-end website applications as well as front-end website architecture. As a backend developer, I was able to enhance my skills in the Laravel framework, Rest API, and MySQL.</p>
            <p>During the instability of the company's performance in November 2020, I transferred to my current company name PT. Selalu Siap Solusi (KiriminAja) as software development lead, where I am responsible for researching existing stacks, offering functional changes as needed, creating and delivering new platforms, and resolving current tasks with teammates.</p>
            <p>As a developer who is interested in many new things, I plan to add focus to Product Management and UI / UX development. Furthermore I plan to experiment with new things that are relevant to my current interests.</p>
