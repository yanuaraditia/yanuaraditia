							<p>My name is Yanuar Aditia. Born and raised in Kebumen, Central Java, and currently reside in Yogyakarta.
								I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in informatics engineering from the University of Amikom Yogyakarta,
								with a focus on database and web development.</p>
							<p>During my academic years, I participated in various activities to increase my skills in full-stack web
								development, including winning the AMICTA competition. My project focuses on how to integrate apps into
								the "internet of things" to handle a parking lot availability issue. Since February 2020, I've been
								working as a full-stack web developer for TRIES DIGITAL. I was in charge of creating back-end website
								applications as well as front-end website architecture. As a backend developer, I was able to enhance my
								skills in the Laravel framework, Rest API, and MySQL.</p>
							<p>During the instability of the company's performance in November 2020, I transferred to my current
								company name PT. Selalu Siap Solusi (KiriminAja) as software development lead, where I am responsible
								for researching existing stacks, offering functional changes as needed, creating and delivering new
								platforms, and resolving current tasks with teammates.</p>
							<p>As a developer who is interested in many new things, I plan to add focus to Product Management and UI /
								UX development. Furthermore I plan to experiment with new things that are relevant to my current
								interests.</p>
